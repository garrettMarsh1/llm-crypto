# üß† RLHF for Crypto Trading: Complete Guide

This guide explains how to use Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to train your crypto trading model, based on techniques used by major AI companies like OpenAI for mathematical reasoning.

## üéØ **What is RLHF for Trading?**

RLHF trains your model to provide **step-by-step analysis** rather than just final decisions. Instead of just saying "BUY BTC", the model learns to:

1. **Analyze technical indicators** (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
2. **Assess risk factors** (volatility, position sizing)
3. **Consider market context** (sentiment, news, trends)
4. **Generate trading signals** with clear reasoning

## üöÄ **How Big AI Companies Use RLHF**

### **OpenAI's Process Supervision**
- **Outcome Supervision**: Only final answers are evaluated
- **Process Supervision**: Each reasoning step is evaluated and rewarded
- **Result**: Much better reasoning, fewer hallucinations

### **Key Techniques**
1. **Step-by-Step Rewards**: Each analysis step gets a reward signal
2. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the quality of each reasoning step
3. **Confidence Calibration**: Reward appropriate confidence levels
4. **Outcome Integration**: Learn from actual trading results

## üèóÔ∏è **Our RLHF Implementation**

### **Step Types We Supervise**
1. **Technical Analysis**: RSI, MACD, trend analysis, support/resistance
2. **Risk Assessment**: Volatility, position sizing, stop losses
3. **Market Context**: Sentiment, news, macro factors
4. **Signal Generation**: Final trading decision with reasoning

### **Reward System**
```python
# Base rewards
correct_step: 0.5
incorrect_step: -0.2
high_confidence_correct: 0.3
low_confidence_incorrect: 0.1

# Outcome-based rewards
profitable_trade: 0.5
losing_trade: -0.3
avoided_loss: 0.2

# Step-specific rewards
technical_analysis:
  mentions_rsi: 0.1
  mentions_macd: 0.1
  mentions_bollinger: 0.1
  mentions_support_resistance: 0.1
```

## üìä **Training Process**

### **Phase 1: Data Preparation**
```bash
# Prepare your crypto data
python scripts/prepare_training_data.py --symbols BTC-USD ETH-USD SOL-USD DOGE-USD
```

### **Phase 2: Initial Fine-tuning**
```bash
# Fine-tune with LoRA first
python scripts/train_crypto_model.py --config training_config.yaml
```

### **Phase 3: RLHF Training**
```bash
# Run RLHF training
python scripts/run_rlhf_training.py --config rlhf_config.yaml --samples 5000
```

## üîß **Configuration**

### **RLHF Config (`rlhf_config.yaml`)**
```yaml
rlhf:
  learning_rate: 1e-5
  reward_learning_rate: 1e-4
  batch_size: 4
  reward_epochs: 10
  rl_epochs: 5

process_supervision:
  steps:
    - "technical_analysis"
    - "risk_assessment"
    - "market_context"
    - "signal_generation"
  
  step_weights:
    technical_analysis: 0.3
    risk_assessment: 0.25
    market_context: 0.2
    signal_generation: 0.25
```

## üìà **Expected Results**

### **Before RLHF**
```
User: Analyze BTC market data
Model: BUY BTC (confidence: 0.8)
```

### **After RLHF**
```
User: Analyze BTC market data
Model: 
**Technical Analysis:**
- RSI at 65 indicates neutral conditions
- MACD shows bullish momentum above zero line
- Price above 20-day moving average confirms uptrend
- Volume increasing supports bullish move

**Risk Assessment:**
- Volatility at 3% is moderate
- Recommend 2-3% position size
- Set stop loss at 2% below entry
- Good timing with increasing volume

**Market Context:**
- Fear & Greed index shows "Greed" sentiment
- Positive news flow supporting crypto
- Institutional buying pressure increasing
- Regulatory environment stable

**Trading Signal: BUY**
- Confidence: 0.85
- Reasoning: Strong technical setup with bullish momentum, moderate risk, and positive sentiment
- Position Size: 2-3% of portfolio
- Stop Loss: 2% below entry
- Take Profit: 6-8% above entry
```

    'close': 45000,
    'change_24h': 2.5,
    'rsi': 65,

- Step-by-step market analysis
- Trading-specific reward functions
- Real-world outcome integration

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Start with Basic RLHF**: Use the provided scripts
2. **Customize Rewards**: Adjust reward functions for your needs
3. **Add More Steps**: Include additional analysis types
4. **Integrate Real Data**: Use actual trading outcomes
5. **Scale Up**: Train on more data and longer sequences

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**
